## About

EE 392D is a graduate course that covers work and current topics related to wireless communication and sensing systems. The course consists of reading and discussing published research papers, presenting recent work on wireless sensing systems, and completing an original research project. 

## Prerequisites
EE 392 is open to all graduate students as well as advanced undergraduate students. While the course has no official prerequisites, a mature understanding of wireless communication and sensing is required.

## Course Structure

### Reading and Discussion (30%)
We will read and discuss 1-2 papers for each class. Students should come prepared to discuss assigned papers and make substantive intellectual contributions. This means that you need to read each paper ahead of time thoroughly. Before each lecture, students will submit a short summary (400 word) for each paper and propose one discussion question for each class. 

Students will submit the reading assignments through [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/901342) by **1 PM on the day of each class**. Paper summaries should be completed without the help of LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT).

Grading will based **20% on the written responses** and **10% on in-class participation**. Late submissions on written assignments are not permitted, but students may skip one paper summary and one lectures without penalty. Participation grades are based on attendance and active participation during class discussions. 

### Topic Presentation (15%)
Each student will present a recent paper during the quarter that is relevant to that day's class topic. During the first week of the quarter students will have the opportunity to sign up for a topic presentation. As part of the topic presentation, students are expected to perform a literature search and select a paper that was published within the last 5 years from a top-tier venue (e.g., Mobicom, NSDI, MobiSys, Sensys, SIGCOMM, IPSN, IMWUT, CHI). 

* Students must submit their papers for approaval to the teaching staff at least three days before their scheduled presentation. 
* Presentations will be 15 minutes with 5 minutes for questions. 

### Course Project (55%)
Students will complete a quarter-long original research project in small groups (1-3 students) on a topic of their own choosing. Groups will present their work during the last two sections as well as submit a 4-6 page report, similar to the papers we read in the course. 

Project grading is broken down into four components:

* Project Proposal (5%): Groups will meet with the course staff to discuss their project during the third week of class and submit a one-page project proposal. Details on how to prepare the proposal is in the assignment description.
* Mid-Quarter Progress Report (5%): Students will submit a short (1-2 pages) progress report mid-quarter. The report should indicate what has been accomplished, what is remaining to be completed, challenges the team has faced, and any preliminary results. 
* Presentation (10%): Groups will give a 15-minute class presentation during the last week of the course.  
* Final Paper (35%): Groups will give a 15-minute class presentation during the last week of the course. 
Final Paper (35%): Groups will submit a final project report similar to the papers that were read. Papers should be 6-8 pages and use the USENIX LaTeX template. Students who are not familiar with LaTex can use a Word template. However, using LaTex is highly encouraged. 

**Well executed projects can lead to publications at top-tier conferences and workshops.**

## Course Policies
