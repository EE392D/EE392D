## About

EE 392D is a graduate-level course on mobile computing and ubiquitous sensing. The course covers a broad range of topics, including wireless sensing, localization, wireless communication, energy harvesting, RFID, mobile health sensing, and the Internet of Things for the environment. Students will read research papers, participate in group discussions, and complete a final project in small groups.

## Prerequisites
EE 392 is open to all graduate students as well as advanced undergraduate students. While the course has no official prerequisites, a mature understanding of wireless communication and sensing is required.

## Course Structure

### Reading and Discussion (30%)
We will read and discuss 1-2 papers for each class. Students should come prepared to discuss assigned papers and make substantive intellectual contributions. This means that you need to read each paper ahead of time thoroughly. Before each lecture, students will submit a short summary (400 word) for each paper and propose one discussion question for each class. 

Students will submit the reading assignments through [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1208239) by **1 PM on the day of each class**. Paper summaries should be written without the help of LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT).

Grading will based **20% on the written responses** and **10% on in-class participation**. Late submissions on written assignments are not permitted, but students may skip one paper summary and one lectures without penalty. Participation grades are based on attendance and active participation during class discussions. 

### Topic Presentation (15%)
Each student will present a research paper twice during the quarter. During the first week of the quarter students will have the opportunity to sign up for a topic presentation. Students are expected to present on one of the assigned research papers. Presentations will be 15 minutes long and details on presentation requirements can be found [here]()

### Course Project (55%)
Students will complete a quarter-long original research project in small groups (1-3 students) on a topic of their own choosing. Groups will present their work during the last two sections as well as submit a 4-6 page report, similar to the papers we read in the course. 

Project grading is broken down into four components:

* **Project Proposal (5%):** Groups will meet with the instructor to discuss their project during the third week of class and submit a one-page project proposal. Details on how to prepare the proposal is in the assignment description.
* **Mid-Quarter Progress Report (5%):** Students will submit a short (1-2 pages) progress report mid-quarter. The report should indicate what has been accomplished, what is remaining to be completed, challenges the team has faced, and any preliminary results. 
* **Presentation (10%):** Groups will give a 15-minute class presentation during the last week of the course.  
* **Final Paper (35%):** Groups will submit a final project report similar to the papers that were read. Papers should be 4-6 pages and use the USENIX LaTeX template. Students who are not familiar with LaTex can use a Word template. However, using LaTex is highly encouraged. 

**Well executed projects can lead to publications at top-tier conferences and workshops.**

## Course Policies

## Access and Accommodations
Stanford is committed to providing equal educational opportunities for disabled students. Disabled students are a valued and essential part of the Stanford community. We welcome you to our class. If you experience disability, please register with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate your needs, support appropriate and reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Academic Accommodation Letter for faculty. To get started or to re-initiate services, please visit [oae.stanford.edu](oae.stanford.edu).

If you already have an Academic Accommodation Letter, we invite you to share your letter with us. Academic Accommodation Letters should be shared at the earliest possible opportunity so we may partner with you and OAE to identify any barriers to access and inclusion that might be encountered in your experience of this course.

Stanford as an institution is committed to the highest quality education, and as your teaching team, our first priority is to uphold your educational experience.
